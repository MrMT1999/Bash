This is a bash code that can store your password on a textfile to keep them for as long as you want!


input the code into a text file in linux environment and give it a name that you want and save it with .sh format
for example I give it "Password.sh"

after that you have to add it into the shell by the code below in command environment

chmod +x Password.sh

after that you can run it just by going into the directort you've stored the file 
use the code "cd" for navigation 

and finaly run the code with 
./Password.sh
